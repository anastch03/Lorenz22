WheelAssembly You may choose to have this class to model the entire assembly of wheels. 
This class holds the collection of (18) wheels, and handles anything that would affect them as a group.
Reads the settings from wheel.txt 
Reads the initial settings from -i command line
Increments certain wheel positions based on given intermediate value (see encryption step 11).
